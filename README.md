# Introduction to Azure Open AI Assistants

This repo is intended as a template for Microsoft AI Tour repositories

## Session Desciption

The OpenAI Assistants API allows you to build conversational agents that can understand and respond to user inputs. You can use the API to automate tasks, provide information, or guide users through a process.

The Assistants API is not the only way to build conversational agents, but it offers several advantages:

1. Simplicity: The API abstracts away the complexity of building a conversational agent, allowing you to focus on the content and logic of the conversation.
2. Scalability: The API is designed to handle a large number of concurrent users, making it suitable for production use.
3. Customization: The API allows you to customize the behavior of the assistant by providing training data and defining conversational flows.
4. Integration: The API can be integrated with other services and systems, allowing you to build assistants that interact with external data sources.
