#### The Contoso Tents Datasheet

The **contoso-tents-datasheet.pdf** file used in the demo is in the **datasheet** folder for **demo-1** of this repository.

### Background

The app is built using the [Azure OpenAI Assistants API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/assistants) and [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/), with the backend powered by the Azure OpenAI Assistants API and app is written in Python. It demonstrates best practices for creating a conversational agent with this API. To enhance performance, the app is fully asynchronous, uses the FastAPI framework, and streams all responses to users in real-time.

### The Contoso Sales Assistant Source Code

The demo source code is available in the [Contoso Sales Assistant built with the Azure OpenAI Assistant API and Chainlit](https://github.com/gloveboxes/contoso-sales-azure-openai-assistant) repository.

### How the demo works

The demo uses a SQLite Contoso Sales Database with 40,000 rows of synthetic data. When the app starts, it reads the schema, product categories, product types, and reporting years, then adds this info to the Azure OpenAI Assistants API instruction context.

With this setup, the Azure OpenAI GPT-4 LLM and Assistants API can answer questions about Contosoâ€™s sales data, generate SQL queries, and run them on the read-only SQLite database using function calls. The LLM and Code Interpreter can also run Python code to create visualizations, such as pie charts and tables, and generate Excel files for users to download for further analysis.

_This solution can be easily adapted to support other scenarios, such as customer support, simply by changing the database and adjusting the Azure OpenAI Assistants API instructions to fit the new use case._

### Objections

A common concern with the demo scenario is security, particularly the risks of SQL injection or malicious attempts to drop the database. While these concerns are valid, they can be mitigated by setting the database to read-only mode. For SQLite, this involves configuring the database as read-only. For a Database Service, you would assign the application a read-only (Select) role. Additionally, running the application in a secure environment provides an extra layer of protection.

In enterprise scenarios, data is extracted and transformed from transactional systems into a read-only database or data warehouse. This approach ensures the data is secure, optimized for performance, and that the application has read-only access to the data.

### Demo Considerations

1. This is the demo script used in the video, but since the application is powered by a large language model (LLM), conversations will vary. **Be prepared to adapt based on the responses you receive.** Feel free to customize the script as needed; it serves as a guide rather than a strict rule. **However, be aware that some prompts may produce large amounts of data, which can be tedious for the audience as it streams to the assistant. To maintain engagement, it's best to use prompts that generate concise responses. The assistant instructions favour data aggregates to reduce data returned from the database.**

2. The chat window shows the LLM [Chain of Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#Chain-of-thought), this is enabled to help understand the context of the conversation. **You can show the SQL queries and results from the "Function Calling" tool, and the Python code generated by the "Code Interpreter" tool by clicking their associated dropdowns.** Note, there is an overhead to Chain of Thought" as the context needs to be streamed to the chat window. In production, you would turn "Chain of Thought" off.
3. The Code Interpreter performance execution times can vary a lot, this is dependent on the code complexity, location, and time of day, so be patient when waiting for the Python code to execute and have talking points ready to fill the time.

### The Demo Script

1. From your browser, navigate to the [Contoso Sales Assistant](https://aka.ms/contoso-sales-assistant) website.
2. Login with your GitHub account to get a demo key.
3. Follow the instructions for the event, copy your API Key and navigate API Assistant demo.

#### Set the Assistant UX to Light Mode

Suggest setting light mode as generally better for an audience.

1. From the top right, select user icon
1. Select Light Mode
1. Start with chat history closed

#### Start the conversation

There are prompt starters in the chat window. The user can select these to start the conversation.

1. Select **Help**.
   This will provide a list of sample questions that the assistant can answer. Remember, on startup, the assistant loaded the database schema, product categories, product types, and reporting years, so it has this context to work with when providing help.
2. Select **Help in \<Your Preferred Language>**. (e.g., Help in Dutch, Help in French, etc.). This will provide a list of sample questions that the assistant can answer in the selected language.
3. You can demo in your preferred language but be sure to test the language support first.
4. Select **Start new chart**.
5. Select the 2nd from left starter.
   * Create a vivid pie chart of sales by region.

   The LLM will generate a SQL query, next the LLM will call the **ask_database** function to execute the query and return the results. The LLM will then generate the Python code to create the pie chart.

6. Next, we'll ask about beginner-friendly tents. The sales database has limited knowledge of the products as the focus of the database is sales data, so the LLM will generate a **limited** response based on the data available.

   **What beginner-friendly tents does Contoso sell?**

7. Next, we'll going to upload a Contoso Tents Datasheet to the Assistants API. This will allow the assistant to provide more detailed information about the tents. The Assistants API will vectorize the PDF and store the data in the database and the LLM will be able to access the data using hybrid (semantic and keyword) queries.

   1. Drag and drop the **contoso-tents-datasheet.pdf** onto the Contoso Sales Assistant. The assistant will now have access to the tent data. The pdf is in the **datasheet** folder for **demo-1** of this repository.
   2. Add the prompt **What beginner-friendly tents does Contoso sell?**
   3. Add resubmit the question.

   Now the assistant has access to the tent data and can provide more detailed information.

8. Now, we're going to combine the data from the sales database and the tent datasheet to provide a more detailed analysis.

   Submit the following prompt: **Show sales of tents by region and include a brief description in the table about each tent.**

9. Finally, let's use the Assistants API and the code interpreter to generate a report on the sales of beginner-friendly tents in Excel format.

   Submit the following prompt: **Create an excel file**

   The LLM will generate the Python code to create the Excel file. You can download the file by selecting the download link and open in Excel.

## Introduction to the Demo

This demo showcases how to use the AI Studio Assistants Playground for data analysis and visualization with the Assistants API Code Interpreter. In this session, the user guides the conversation, and the assistant generates answers and visualizations. The model interprets user queries and dynamically generates code, which the Code Interpreter executes. Results are displayed in the chat window.

Previously, users had to manually code for data analysis and visualization. The AI Studio Assistants Playground transforms this by enabling natural language queries, allowing the assistant to generate the required code.

The playground offers two tools: Code Interpreter and File Search. File Search supports file uploads and both keyword and semantic searches for RAG-style interactions. This demo focuses on the Code Interpreter, designed to write and execute code for data analysis and visualization.

## Why is the Code Interpreter so interesting?

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating natural language text. Although LLMs may not be inherently strong in performing mathematical operations, they are highly effective at writing code to handle complex calculations, generate charts, create visualizations, and more. The Code Interpreter feature allows LLMs to dynamically generate and execute code in real-time, enabling them to answer queries and perform a wide range of computational tasks efficiently.

## Start the conversation

Below is an example conversation flow. Note that the actual interaction may vary due to the inherent behavior of the AI model:
