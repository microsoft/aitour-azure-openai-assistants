    "## Azure AI Agent Service\n",
    "Azure AI Agent service builds upon Azure OpenAI Assistants API to provide an **enterprise-grade** solution for building scalable agents safely and securely. It integrates with an **extensive ecosystem of tools** to enable agents to ground their knowledge in real-time data (e.g. Azure AI Search, Sharepoint and Bing Search) and to **act on behalf of users** (e.g. Logic Apps and Azure Functions).\n",
    "Azure AI Agent Service also allows a flexible model choice, going beyond the OpenAI collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The service is accessible through the [Azure AI Foundry SDK](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/aiplatformblog/ignite-2024-announcing-the-azure-ai-foundry-sdk/4295862), which provides a simplified coding experience to build AI applications. "
